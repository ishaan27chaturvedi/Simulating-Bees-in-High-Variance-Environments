# Simulating-Bees-in-High-Variance-Environments

Copy when uncertain: Simulating the foraging behavior of bumblebees, relying on social information when rewards are highly variable

## Description

This code is simulating the model as described in this [paper](https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/2537481/mod_resource/content/1/rsbl.2016.0188.pdf)
<br><br>To understand the model completely, please read the following as well:

* [Study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281710852_Competition_for_resources_can_explain_patterns_of_social_and_individual_learning_in_nature) this is based on (read the model) 

I have also added a presentation (pdf) that I created, as well as the consolidated data from the study.
